<h1>Dynamic Emissives</h1>

*GLOW UP! **Supports 1.21.4+***
</div>

Fully emissive and transparent emissive blocks, display entities, particles, paintings, and any other entity! Inspired by ShockMicro's [VanillaDynamicEmissives](https://github.com/ShockMicro/VanillaDynamicEmissives).

## üîß How to use
- Set the opacity of a pixel to `252` to make it emissive.
- The default transparent emissive opacity values include: `2`, `27`, `52`, `77`, `102`, `127`, `152`, `177`, `202`, and `227`. You can really easily add/remove opacity values in [*shaders/include/config/dynamic_emissives_config.glsl*](assets/minecraft/shaders/include/config/dynamic_emissives_config.glsl).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This will likely break in optifine! If it does, I do not have any intentions to fix it.
